This project was designed to gain experience in the finance industry. The data was obtained from the [World Bank](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx). Since the `.csv` file is over the 25MG limit (348MG) for GitHub it was compressed, and the SQL queries were put into a file to read. Through this project, I learned the basics of SQL, from the SELECT statement to the ORDER BY statement. It went through some simple aggregations such as COUNT, SUM, and AVG. I learned a lot and truly enjoyed working with finance data and SQL.

## Scope:
For this project, I've been hired as a data analyst by the World Bank to look over all of their bank loans & give them insights. The dataset is a snapshot that was taken in November of 2022.
